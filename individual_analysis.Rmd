## Overview

**This tutorial demonstrates individual-level analysis of processed fiber photometry dopamine data as well as song production from juvenile songbirds. The analysis examines dopamine transient patterns, peak amplitudes, and their relationship to vocal behavior development using the VNS and ASAP packages.**\

## Information Theory Analysis

### Figure Q-R

Representative example showing predictive coding development between early and late motif segments.
