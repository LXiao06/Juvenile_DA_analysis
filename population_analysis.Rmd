## Overview

**This tutorial demonstrates population-level analysis of processed fiber photometry dopamine data from juvenile songbirds. The analysis examines temporal dynamics, amplitude shifts, and information flow patterns across multiple animals using the VNS package.**\

> ### Install Required Packages
>
> ```{r, install_pkgs, eval = FALSE}
> remotes::install_local(file.path(getwd(),"pkgs", "VNS_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz"),
>                       dependencies = TRUE)
> ```

## Load Package

```{r, load_pkgs, eval = EVAL}
library("VNS")
```

\

## Load Population Data

Load the population data created from the data processing and individual analysis pipeline.

```{r, load_data, eval = EVAL}
load("./data/population_data.rda")
```

\

## Pooling Workflow

This guide demonstrates how to generate population-level data by processing individual animal and combining them into a unified dataset. The workflow consists of four main steps:

### STEP 1: Load Individual NPM Object

```{r, step1, eval = FALSE}
npm <- readRDS("./data/npm_B633.rds")
```

\

### STEP 2: Compute Metrics for Individual Animals

For each animal, we calculate specific TD metrics (e.g., conditional entropy(cH))

```{r, step2, eval = FALSE}
B633_res <- npm |>
  create_segment_table(region ="reg0",
                       window = c(-0.4, 0.4),
                       n_segments= 4,
                       min_epoch = 50) |>
  analyze_directional_cH(source_seg = 1, target_seg = 4,
                         output ="data.frame")
```

\

### STEP 3: Iterate Across All Animals

Apply the same analysis pipeline to each animal in the dataset. This ensures consistent processing and comparable results across subjects.

\

### STEP 4: Combine Individual Results into Population Data

Pool all individual animal results into a single data frame. 
'combine_animal_results' function:
- Merges individual data frames
- Adds animal identifiers for tracking
- Preserves all computed metrics for population-level analysis

```{r, step4, eval = FALSE}
cH_res <- combine_animal_results(
  list(B633_res, P568_res, P569_res, R561_res,R562_res),
  c("B633", "P568", "P569", "R561", "R562")
)
```

\

## Temporal Shift

### Linear Mixed Effects Modeling

```{r, temporal_lmm, eval = EVAL}
td_res <- analyze_td_metrics(temporal_shift_res)
```

\

### Figure D-G

Population-level analysis of temporal difference learning metrics across vocal development.

Linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) showing developmental trajectories of dopamine transient characteristics (n = 49 observations from 5 birds, 63-91 dph). Median peak timing decreases with development (top-left). Backward shift rate increases with development (top-right). Temporal entropy decreases with development (lower-left). Gini coefficient increases with development (lower-right).

```{r, FigD-G, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, eval = EVAL}
plot_td_panel(temporal_shift_res,show_title = FALSE, show_annotations = FALSE)
```

```{r, img1, echo=FALSE, eval=!EVAL}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/FigD-G.png")
```
Each colored dot represents the mean value for one animal at a given age, with colors indicating individual animals.

Black lines show population-level fixed effects from LMMs with animal identity as random intercept.

\

### Within Window Analysis

```{r, within_window, eval = EVAL}
td_res2 <- analyze_within_window_trends(temporal_shift_res,
                                        test_method = "both",
                                        window_size = 6,
                                        plot_results = FALSE)
```

\

### Figure H-K

Paired comparison of temporal discrimination metrics between the first day (Day i) and last day (Day i + 6) of 6-day sliding windows across the experimental period. Median peak timing significantly decreased within windows (top-left). 

Backward shift rate significantly increased within windows (top-right). Temporal entropy showed no significant change within windows (lower-left). Gini coefficient showed no significant change within windows (lower-right).

```{r, FigH-K, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, eval = EVAL}
plot_paired_metric_panel(td_res2, window_size = 6,
                      metric_order = c("peak_timing","backward_shift",  "entropy", "gini"),
                      ncol = 2)
```

```{r, img2, echo=FALSE, eval=!EVAL}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/FigH-K.png")
```
Gray lines connect paired observations from individual animals within the same temporal window (n = 57 paired observations from 5 birds across 24 windows). 

Red lines and symbols indicate group means ± SEM. 

\

                                         test_method = "both",
                                         window_size = 6,
                                         plot_results = FALSE)
